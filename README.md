# exquisite-templates
A collection of shared file templates for use in $HOME/Templates on Linux systems

## A note about the Templates directory
Despite being an XDG standard, and being available out of the box on most Linux distributions,
the $HOME/Templates directory is not widely understood by new users, despite being an incredibly
useful and time-saving tool.

The concept of the Templates directory is that it allows you to save files of ANY type you wish
that can serve as the starting points for creating new files. Most popular Linux file browsers,
including Nautilus and Pantheon Files, automatically populate a menu when right-clicking an empty area
that allows you to create a new file. This menu is populated by the files stored in your Templates
folder.

## Contributions
Please feel free to contribute files which you find especially useful and elegant. If we feel that the
quality is up to par with the rest of the repository, and could potentially be useful to multiple users
(i.e. not an individualized use case) we will gladly merge the PR.

Please keep the following requirements in mind:
* You may only include files which you have created, or files with an open source license permitting us to include it in our project.
* If you copy material from a website, you must obtain the author's permission for use specifically in this project.
